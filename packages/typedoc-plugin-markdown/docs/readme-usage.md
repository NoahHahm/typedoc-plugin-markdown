# Readme Usage

TypeDoc by default will attempt to resolve a projects Readme file. In addition TypeDoc's a path to a specfic file can be provided using the `--readme` option. This can be set to `none` to disable Readme page generation.

## Injecting the TypeDoc index page

When a readme file is resolved a separate index file is generated acting as the root into the generated documentation.
